/**
 * Simply injects the sticky post IDs into the actual mySQL order by clause, 
 * causing posts to be ordered by sticky status then by what ever order is 
 * specified, usually post_date DESC, and not to repeat on subsequent pages. 
 * I can't actually figure out why it isn't done like this by WP, perhaps 
 * earlier versions of mySQL don't support this. WP's default sticky ordering 
 * craziness is turned off by returning an empty array for the next call to
 * get_option('sticky_posts') which happens in WP_Query->get_posts().
